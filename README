Floodgate is a research peer-to-peer architecture that aimed at 
providing a scalable Content Delivery Network-like system by 
incentivising the peers to share their resources for monetary 
benefits.

It was part of the Ph.D. work carried out by Srijith Nair
(https://srijith.net) at Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam.

Version 1.0 of the Floodgate sourc code, based on the BitTorrent 
5.0.7 reference implementation is available for download here, 
under the same license as the BitTorrent itself - 'BitTorrent 
Open Source License'. This code was released on 30th July, 2008.

The code was developed in collaboration with Erik Zentveld.

Peer-reviewed publication associated with this work is:
Srijith K. Nair, Erik Zentveld, Bruno Crispo, Andrew S. Tanenbaum, 
"Floodgate: A Micropayment Incentivised P2P Content Delivery Network"
17th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications and 
Networks (ICCCN 2008), August 3 - 7, 2008, St. Thomas U.S. Virgin
